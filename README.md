# vltagersattning
At this point with train delays and canceled trains the Swedish Railways system is considered a national joke. In fact the main operator, SJ AB, is spelled bajs (shit), backwards. In their honor I am working on this project to makes it easy for certain people in the county of Västmanland to get compensated for this problem. vltagersattning, or VL tågersättning in Swedish, is a TUI (Terminal User Interface) program that aids in getting compensated for late or canceled trains within the Västmanland county for people who travel with Västmanlands länstrafik. That is the public transport of Västmanland county. 

This program is supposed to make it easier to get compensated through VL, because there is too much friction in the process.
